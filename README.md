# Bargain-Central-Store

This JavaScript program was created for my AP Computer Science Principles class as part of the **Using Abstractions Project**.  
It simulates an online shopping experience, using **functions** to calculate totals and apply tax.

## Features

- Prompts the user to enter names and quantities for three items
- Displays prices and calculates totals for each item
- Uses custom functions to:
  - Calculate the total price per item
  - Calculate the subtotal and total (with tax)
- Rounds all totals to two decimal places

## Purpose

This project was made to practice **functions**, **parameters**, **return values**, and basic math operations in JavaScript.

> Note: I’m keeping the original code structure as written during the project — it reflects my learning process and growing skills!
